### Visualizing Results
The simulator itself is not a graphical program. To reduce complexity, it just
computes the value of the E field for each node every timestep. This data is 
given to the user as a 2D matrix of floating point values. GNUPlot can be used
to visualize the field as a heatmap. Commonly used GNUPlot scripts are included
in the `plots` directory for getting started.

```
$> gnuplot plots/heatmap.gp
```

#### Creating an e-field animation.
GNUPlot can also be used to create a .gif animation of the e-field evolution
over time. This is done using the mesh.gp script. Replace the timestamp with
the one generated by the simulator.

```
$> gnuplot -e "DIR='XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX'" plots/mesh.gp
```
